because i forgot

## Note:

Reminder is still under development and is a bit ambitiously aimed to be done in three days. Unfortunately, contributions are not being accepted until it has an actual ready release (i plan on changing a lot of code and do frequently get ideas at 1 AM) and is suitable for testing. However, don't hesitate to report any bugs!

(Note: As of August 2024, it will likely be broken half the time and everything is currently a bit of a mess...)


## Goal:

Issue: idk

Ok, time to get started!

### Getting Started:

First, make sure you installed all the neccesary python modules! (Any modules that don't come with python are listened down below!) Next, either clone this repository, or get the latest release from the releases tab, and run [`main.py`](/main.py)! Check [`MANUAL.md`](/MANUAL.md) for some tips of how to use this, and check [`CODEGUIDE.md`](/CODEGUIDE.md) if you're interested in the code!

### Modules Used (that dont come with python):
- numpy
- PIL (Pillow)
