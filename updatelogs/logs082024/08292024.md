# 8/29/2024 - 1st Update!

so last night in my dream some person came up to me and told me that i forgot to do something, and that made me realize that i forget a lot of things, which was the original reason why i started using a calander tool (to better manage my time and to not forget things) but now i want to make my own reminders calander thing

ok gonna setup the repository now... hmm taking a bit more than a few seconds... oh wait i messed this up. ok, fixed it, ivo has been copied over! gonna setup the updatelogs, updatelogs setup!

so, to clarify, the goal is to create some calander-like tool, where you can create events and stuff, but added with reminders functionality, and (hopefully) is both drag to modify and text based for editing (probably with a new large text box visual object and a new draggable line visual object). gonna create a mockup of the goal real quick...

oh wait i should set up the readme.md... ok, updated the readme, time to work on the mockup!

hmm getting somewhere?
