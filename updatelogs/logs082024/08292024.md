# 8/29/2024 - 1st Update!

so last night in my dream some person came up to me and told me that i forgot to do something, and that made me realize that i forget a lot of things, which was the original reason why i started using a calander tool (to better manage my time and to not forget things) but now i want to make my own reminders calander thing

ok gonna setup the repository now... hmm taking a bit more than a few seconds... oh wait i messed this up. ok, fixed it, ivo has been copied over! gonna setup the updatelogs, updatelogs setup!

so, to clarify, the goal is to create some calander-like tool, where you can create events and stuff, but added with reminders functionality, and (hopefully) is both drag to modify and text based for editing (probably with a new large text box visual object and a new draggable line visual object). gonna create a mockup of the goal real quick...

oh wait i should set up the readme.md... ok, updated the readme, time to work on the mockup!

hmm getting somewhere?

ok, time to start working on the code! ok, got the methods and numbers set, seems to be working! let me quickly cleanup this code... ok, looks better now! idk where to start, so ill probably start with the date area (the mini calendar i guess?)

uh what does this mean? probably not important right!...

ok its a long while later with lots of errors and stuff, but its working now! also got the text color working! ok, changed it more so that now the calendar color is white if its today, a bit grey if it is in this month but not today, and more grey if its not this month! oops forgot about the day of the week on the top... ok fixed! its looking pretty good!
