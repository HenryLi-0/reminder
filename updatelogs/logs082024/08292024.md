# 8/29/2024 - 1st Update!

so last night in my dream some person came up to me and told me that i forgot to do something, and that made me realize that i forget a lot of things, which was the original reason why i started using a calander tool (to better manage my time and to not forget things) but now i want to make my own reminders calander thing

ok gonna setup the repository now... hmm taking a bit more than a few seconds... oh wait i messed this up. ok, fixed it, ivo has been copied over! gonna setup the updatelogs, updatelogs setup!

so, to clarify, the goal is to create some calander-like tool, where you can create events and stuff, but added with reminders functionality, and (hopefully) is both drag to modify and text based for editing (probably with a new large text box visual object and a new draggable line visual object). gonna create a mockup of the goal real quick...

oh wait i should set up the readme.md... ok, updated the readme, time to work on the mockup!

hmm getting somewhere?

ok im back, time to finish up the mockup and possibly start measuring the distances

![yay](</updatelogs/images/082024/08292024 - 2.png>)

ok i think we got the numbers, https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ezwcq9eylc

now, time to draw it out and start measuring the coordinates

![yay](</updatelogs/images/082024/08292024 - 3.png>)

there we go! time to calculate sizes and put the numbers in! ok, numbers entered into `settings.py` , now time to work on the code...

ok, time to start working on the code! ok, got the methods and numbers set, seems to be working! let me quickly cleanup this code... ok, looks better now! idk where to start, so ill probably start with the date area (the mini calendar i guess?)

![huh](</updatelogs/images/082024/08292024 - 5.png>)

uh what does this mean? probably not important right!...

ok its a long while later with lots of errors and stuff, but its working now! also got the text color working! ok, changed it more so that now the calendar color is white if its today, a bit grey if it is in this month but not today, and more grey if its not this month! oops forgot about the day of the week on the top... ok fixed! its looking pretty good!

ok we’re back and it’s time to work on the reminders section of the screen! (I’m gonna put the timer section to the side for now) before that I should probably list what I aim to have...
- multiple lists (one day…)
- easy to add reminders
- scroll (obviously)
- deadlines
- checkboxes (now that I think about it, its also a lot like a check list…)
- saving!!! (probably will be easy because of lists?)

ok coding time!

ok, just decided to optimize the date section a little by moving the function to occasional calls (to be honest, i want this function to update once every day (the day of the month does not change every tick or every second), but it may make the code look a bit ugly, so it has been moved to occasional calls. not super super optimized, but still one nevertheless)

wait, in the middle of working on the reminders, but we should quickly copy over the theme colors! you know, this reminds me of a very annoying memory that i have of my experince volunteering at a place. i joined the tech department, because (well, do i have to explain?), and my second assignment was to edit their website. other people's tasks were "oh just copy and paste this post the other department wrote onto the website". mine's was to change every single textbox, modify the textbox's font and color, on every single page on the website manually (when the head tech person could've done it themselves globally! they could have spent two minutes changing it, but instead, when i brought this up, told me to do it manually! i spent two hours on that!) (now on a completely seperate note, i recieved a 3.7/5 or something for average performance, the second lowest score, when i did the most tedious task!) anyways, rant aside, back to coding!

ok, its displaying! hmm i think i want to try something new, what if instead of a textbox displaying the data, we create textboxes when needed? also that display isn't correctly formatted...

so turns out time.localtime seems to kinda suck? (it appears to crash when putting in huge numbers?)

ok, idk how to fix the issue with time.localtime(), i assume it has something to do with the fact that its based in C... anyways, reminders are now usually a bit greyed out and red when incomplete and after the due date!

just checked the python docs, and it says

> localtime() may raise OverflowError, if the timestamp is outside the range of values supported by the platform C localtime() or gmtime() functions, and OSError on localtime() or gmtime() failure. It’s common for this to be restricted to years between 1970 and 2038.

so i guess i can ignore the issue for now...

ok, im back! so, time to continue working on the reminders section... (hmm what if we add reminder list tabs on the bottom in the future) anyways, editing reminders! (as in, we need to program that) actually, we need to program scrolling first so that we dont have to visit this again

scrolling is working! however, the same problem that i forgot to solve in protoplop is here, it still peeks under the reminders text on top... ok, scrolling works, and its behind it now! also added some fancy line and the name of the reminders list (currently reminders) and the number of reminders on that list!

```
y = i*73+80-self.reminderScrollOffset
y+self.reminderScrollOffset = i*73+80
i = (y+self.reminderScrollOffset-80)/73
```

ok, we can create reminders now! (still cant edit though...) wait i feel like doing something satisfying, what if we add curved edges to the sections of the screen... (this was a think in the concept mockups for tape and protoplop, but i never actually added it to any of the things i made)

YES! YES! FINALLY, SMOOTH CORNERS!

ok, time to start work on making the reminders editable! hmm textbox is appearing but isnt working yet... hmm the text box isnt destorying itself when no longer being interacted with... ok its working now! ok, got the time thing working, but its currently editing the epoch time, which doesnt make sense, but itll work for now... however, detecting editing the reminder name or the time is a bit weird right now... ok, detection is working now! im gonna try to fix the apperance of the textboxes... hmm textboxes are adding a bit funny after this change, im gonna undo the text box changes are try again... ok, seems good!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/082024/08292024 - 8.png>)
