# 8/30/2024 - 2nd Update!

i woke up very early in the morning

![uh](</updatelogs/images/082024/08302024 - 1.png>)

i think i got 5 hours of sleep? anyways, time to start working on the checkbox thing on the side of the lists! hmm, seems like `render.py` never needed to import settings...

ok, reminders now have a new piece of data, each reminder is `[name, date due, finished]`! ok, its appearing properly! now, time to make them clickable... ok we can mark them as complete now! (hmm the reminder text also needs to change formatting...) (if you couldn't tell, im being very careful about the choice of colors for no reason) ok, its behaving properly now! ok im gonna start thinking about how to do this calander thing...

ok, so i think ill do it in a giant list system (probably not the best but whatever) that has every event in one list. when saving, it splits the list to groups of like one hundred so the save files may look like this
```
123-456.txt: [["event name", 123, 234], ["event name", 450, 456], ...]
500-789.txt: [["event name", 500, 502], ["event name", 502, 787], ...]
789-999.txt: [["event name", 789, 999], ["event name", 800, 900], ...]
```
and we should only load the files when needed (like when editing events in the given time range) and keep them in storage when not needed (and also actively update them when changes happen!)

im back after two hours... time to start work on allowing the user to switch between reminders lists! im thinking about making some sort of like tab system on the bottom of the screen (inside the reminders section of the screen)

ok, starting the tabs thing and found a pretty cool numbers when punching in random numbers: (136,163,45,255) reminds me of green terracota... ok, got the logic in for the little bottom thing (and fixed interacting with the area causing reminders to be made)

ok im back from a quick break, yay!

fixed a strange an issue with the checkboxes (the area of detection was still from the top to the bottom)... ok its working! clicking on tabs are working! however, somethings a little up with scrolling, let me fix that real quick... ok its working! hmm i dont like how its clipping off the screen because its position is less than 0 on the screen... i might need to do some math to fix this and make it fancy...

---

aaand we're back, this time with an half hour break! time to work on adding the abitlity to make new reminder list tabs on the bottom, and maybe get to editing them? first, i do want to make the displaying a bit fancier with some math! ok, looking a bit fancier now on the left side! gonna make sure the right side works too...

ok, its working on the right! (ignore placeholder text idk what to put)

ok somethings very broken... the temporary textboxes arent destroying themselves? hmm its working now, but it seems like there is an issue that the text behind it is still being rendered even when its being edited...

hmm, its a bit weird, but the tabs on the bottom are fixed, but not the upper textboxes? ok, all of them have been fixed now!

---

just woke up from sleeping, time to work on adding the ability to create and delete reminders, and possibly also lists! im probably gonna do this with keybinds... ok, deleting reminders seems to work! hmm currently working on deleting lists and trying to make it logical to use... ok, deleting lists now work! also added creating new lists through a similar idea with new reminders! now, theres a strange issue where the item -999 is being removed (which shouldnt happen?) ok, fixed that, and also added a little aesthetic change! lists other than the one the user is on are displayed with a grey color! also, little bug that's been annoying me, when every the user switch to a different list tab, it always goes to editing mode for some reason... ok its been fixed! added keybinds for creating reminders and lists! (both are alt+n)

---

so unfortunately, i forgot what i wanted to do last session for this session, so i think i start work on the calander? ok, first things first, the layout! hmm we're going something that looks like this, so i assume we'll need to write some zooming in and timeline offset code?

ok did a bit of work setting up the data structure of the calendar (idk what to call the code) so i guess time to go back to tape to get some inspiration on the graph stuff... ok, made the code a bit neater, we have the hour thing on the side! sometimes i do reconsider if i should keep making overcomplicated one liners... ok, i think i need to program in some controls to finish this up... im thinking about making the mouse wheel control scrolling up and down, and use control and +/- to zoom in and out?

![waw](</updatelogs/images/082024/08302024 - 4.png>)

ok, just added the scrolling and zoom! zooming currently has limits, but scrolling doesnt have limits just yet...
