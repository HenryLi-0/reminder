i think i got 5 hours of sleep? anyways, time to start working on the checkbox thing on the side of the lists! hmm, seems like `render.py` never needed to import settings...

ok, reminders now have a new piece of data, each reminder is `[name, date due, finished]`! ok, its appearing properly! now, time to make them clickable... ok we can mark them as complete now! (hmm the reminder text also needs to change formatting...) (if you couldn't tell, im being very careful about the choice of colors for no reason) ok, its behaving properly now! ok im gonna start thinking about how to do this calander thing...

ok, so i think ill do it in a giant list system (probably not the best but whatever) that has every event in one list. when saving, it splits the list to groups of like one hundred so the save files may look like this
```
123-456.txt: [["event name", 123, 234], ["event name", 450, 456], ...]
500-789.txt: [["event name", 500, 502], ["event name", 502, 787], ...]
789-999.txt: [["event name", 789, 999], ["event name", 800, 900], ...]
```
and we should only load the files when needed (like when editing events in the given time range) and keep them in storage when not needed (and also actively update them when changes happen!)
