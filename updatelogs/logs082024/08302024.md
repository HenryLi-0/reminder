i woke up very early in the morning

i think i got 5 hours of sleep? anyways, time to start working on the checkbox thing on the side of the lists! hmm, seems like `render.py` never needed to import settings...

ok, reminders now have a new piece of data, each reminder is `[name, date due, finished]`! ok, its appearing properly! now, time to make them clickable... ok we can mark them as complete now! (hmm the reminder text also needs to change formatting...) (if you couldn't tell, im being very careful about the choice of colors for no reason) ok, its behaving properly now! ok im gonna start thinking about how to do this calander thing...

ok, so i think ill do it in a giant list system (probably not the best but whatever) that has every event in one list. when saving, it splits the list to groups of like one hundred so the save files may look like this
```
123-456.txt: [["event name", 123, 234], ["event name", 450, 456], ...]
500-789.txt: [["event name", 500, 502], ["event name", 502, 787], ...]
789-999.txt: [["event name", 789, 999], ["event name", 800, 900], ...]
```
and we should only load the files when needed (like when editing events in the given time range) and keep them in storage when not needed (and also actively update them when changes happen!)

im back after two hours... time to start work on allowing the user to switch between reminders lists! im thinking about making some sort of like tab system on the bottom of the screen (inside the reminders section of the screen)

ok, starting the tabs thing and found a pretty cool numbers when punching in random numbers: (136,163,45,255) reminds me of green terracota... ok, got the logic in for the little bottom thing (and fixed interacting with the area causing reminders to be made)

ok im back from a quick break, yay!

fixed a strange an issue with the checkboxes (the area of detection was still from the top to the bottom)... ok its working! clicking on tabs are working! however, somethings a little up with scrolling, let me fix that real quick... ok its working! hmm i dont like how its clipping off the screen because its position is less than 0 on the screen... i might need to do some math to fix this and make it fancy...

aaand we're back, this time with an half hour break! time to work on adding the abitlity to make new reminder list tabs on the bottom, and maybe get to editing them? first, i do want to make the displaying a bit fancier with some math! ok, looking a bit fancier now on the left side! gonna make sure the right side works too...

ok, its working on the right! (ignore placeholder text idk what to put)

ok somethings very broken... the temporary textboxes arent destroying themselves? hmm its working now, but it seems like there is an issue that the text behind it is still being rendered even when its being edited...

hmm, its a bit weird, but the tabs on the bottom are fixed, but not the upper textboxes? ok, all of them have been fixed now!
