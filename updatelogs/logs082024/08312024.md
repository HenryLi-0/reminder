# 8/31/2024 - 3rd Update!

oops woke up a bit late today...

ok, we need to start fixing the appearance of the calandar events! so calandar events currently have to be in today (the calendar will only show today), so that needs to be fixed... ok i think we need to add date selection to the date section of the screen


```
original
x = i%7*55+25
y = i//7*40+115

invert
i = ((y-115)//40)*7+(x-25)//55
(i think)

account for offset
i = ((y-129)//40)*7+(x-967)//55

account for weird rendering
i = ((y-109)//40)*7+(x-940)//55
```

ok, its working, but the function that updates the date section of the screen is in the loop for being called every 5 seconds, which is sort of interfereing with this. however, instead of making a whole bunch of detections and stuff, im gonna add some form of scheduling sections of the screen to be processed (which should make things cleaner)

ok, so it’s “working” as in updating the section when necessary, but there’s a bit of weird behavior being that it requires me to wait around 3 seconds (I assume it’s probably waiting for the 5 second update) and mouse gets stuck on True...

well, typing that I think the problem might actually be I’m not updating that section telling me that info... wait a minute... ok somethings definetely broken, its being scheduled but isnt running... ok its now fixed! turns out it was something that shouldve worked but idk, its working now! im gonna go optimize some of the other stuff! ok, things have been a bit more optimized (reminders section is only updated when neccesary) and it looks pretty speedy!

ok, started some work on the date conversion things, but its a bit tricky to do...

---

so i just realized that the date section of the screen needs 6 weeks, not 5, so im gonna have to change a couple numbers

the day appears to be 1 number off but i cant tell if its timezones or numbers... ok, im gonna implement this! seems to be working? hmm this old calendar code is strange... hmm experinceing timezone issues... ok, confusing timezone issues have been fixed!

also, forgot to mention, switching between days seems to be working now?

---

ok, im back, time to make sure that calendar is working (by having multi day events), and continue the calendar UI stuff!

ok its working! it can use a bit of fixes with the calendar text and things going past 12AM, but its working!

hmm is the small text or medium text better? ok, did a mix of using the medium text and the small text! (also increased the distance a bit more because my vision is weird) ok so im currently thinking about how to edit

hmm gotta inverse this math

```
temp = time.mktime(time.localtime(event[1]))
temp = (temp - self.selectedCalendarDate*86400)/3600 + TIMEZONE_OFFSET
y1 = (temp-self.calendarOffset)*25/(self.calendarScale+0.000001) + 50

rmy = (temp-self.calendarOffset)*25/(self.calendarScale+0.000001) + 50
(rmy-50)*(self.calendarScale)/25+self.calendarOffset = temp

hmm math currently converts time to yPos, we need yPos to time

temp = (time.mktime(time.localtime(event[1])) - self.selectedCalendarDate*86400)/3600 + TIMEZONE_OFFSET
(rmy-50)*(self.calendarScale)/25+self.calendarOffset = temp
(rmy-50)*(self.calendarScale)/25+self.calendarOffset = (time.mktime(time.localtime(event[1])) - self.selectedCalendarDate*86400)/3600 + TIMEZONE_OFFSET

((rmy-50)*(self.calendarScale)/25+self.calendarOffset-TIMEZONE_OFFSET)*3600 = (time.mktime(time.localtime(event[1])) - self.selectedCalendarDate*86400)
((rmy-50)*(self.calendarScale)/25+self.calendarOffset-TIMEZONE_OFFSET)*3600+self.selectedCalendarDate*86400= time.mktime(time.localtime(event[1]))

```

it appears to be working? im gonna add click to create event now... ok its working!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/082024/08312024 - 1.png>)

---

ok im back, time to start work on editable events! so this may be a bit difficult because its not like reminders where each reminder has the same size. also, idk what to do with events that overlap with eachother. for now, i guess the thing we can do is to find where the user clicked, interate through the list of reminders, and we start editing the first event that has a range that the clicked time is inbetween. unfortunately, this prioritizes earlier events, which maybe a problem for when we have multiple events at the same time, but for now "dont think about it!" (problem for future me).

i should probably make it unable to make an event too close to another... hmm i should probably also make them different colors

ok it now brings up the popup screen! hmm the color generater seems baised towards red and green? strangely, they arent biased?

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/082024/08312024 - 2.png>)

---

ok, time to contine work on making the events editable! ok hopefully this works... oh wait renaming.. yay it works! unfortunately, this brings back the problem of the events going of the screen (it also brings the new issue of having the text be on the event?) hmm it also seems to not render the first day when it goes across two days. ok, the "rendering across days" bug has been fixed, dont really know how to fix the text part (i mean i do know but idk the best way to solve it).

i defintely broke something

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/082024/08312024 - 3.png>)

oh it does not like zooming...

---

ok it's been fixed! turns out adding absolute value was not a smart move, its working now! ok, just checked a couple extra strange cases and moved the top of the bar from 55 to 50, and it seems to be working!

hmm what to do next...

ok, probably should start work on the clock/timer section! so it appears that... uh... we have a lot of space to add more stuff (we do not need to make the text so big i think?) hmm, the large font is a bit large... maybe ill make the large font smaller and use that? 

i guess i should start working on the timer next, the one that says how much time left in an event, and how much time until the next event

wait hold on a second i want the bars to change color as the event progresses

hmm ok "no future events" is working...  hmm its strangely not detecting future events...

---

ok, continuing from last session, gotta fix that weird "not detecting future" issue... ok it seems fixed now! this also made me realize there is no way to delete events from the calendar list as of now

time to make something that converts the difference in second to some fancy time (and also unneccesarrily make it a one liner)

hmm this is a bit tricky

`FORMAT_TIME_DIFF = lambda s: f"{s//3600}:{(s%3600)//60:02}:{s%60:02}" if s >= 3600 else f"{s//60}:{s%60:02}"`

ok unfortunately, it seems a little weird as i just saw an event on the calendar vaporize in front of my eyes, and that the next event seems to be in the past... hmm the timer seems to be behind a couple seconds... ok, fixed the issue, turns out it was a (bad) attempt at timezones which wasnt neccesary here, strangely? anyways, now its a little out of sync with each other (i believe this is rounding?) ok its been fixed!

now, whats going on here...

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/082024/08312024 - 4.png>)

ok its working properly now!

ok, time to put a giant clock in the center! my code is getting a little cursed isnt it "`generateHalfColorBox()`"

???

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/082024/08312024 - 5.png>)

---

time to finish the clock and maybe start saving! first, the strange image from last time, i think i know what it is! i believe it's uninitalized! well that means we just have to initalize it then! ok its now fixed!

ok the math is in! the second hand moves a little strangely (shakes up and down), but all the hands should rely on each other! ok, just added a little circle thing in the middle!

no way do we start work on saving and loading already? i guess so! ok, im gonna proudly sneak back into Tape and Protoplop to get some inspiration... ok time to program in what we need to import and export! decided to use `*.reminder` because idk what other file extension to use (hopefully it isnt already taken...)

ok, its ready to be tested! we just need an export and import button... hmm im thinking of putting it in the timer area... time to draw icons! ok, in my everlonging quest to make the most confusing UI, i honestly dont know which icon is export or import... (

ok, cleaned out the default list settings, left an example in each and i think this is a good one :)

![i think im gonna miss it](</updatelogs/images/082024/08312024 - 6.png>)

i think im gonna miss it (also ignore that left parenthesis up there, its because the right parenthesis turns red in vscode)

yes.

![yes](</updatelogs/images/082024/08312024 - 7.png>)

very good GUI design. anyways, need to connect up the buttons to do something...

ok i just realized a flaw in the importing...

ok so it appears to reimport calendars with the same event... (because they are different colors so are considered different events) ok, its been fixed by making the one event on the calendar a consistent color!

it would be pretty funny if everything broke tommorow because it'll be a new month... (hopefully not)

ok so i just changed my computer time to tommorow, and it seems to be working normally! thats good! hmm it seems like my computer did not like that time travelling trick...
