# 8/31/2024 - 3rd Update!

oops woke up a bit late today...

ok, we need to start fixing the appearance of the calandar events! so calandar events currently have to be in today (the calendar will only show today), so that needs to be fixed... ok i think we need to add date selection to the date section of the screen


```
original
x = i%7*55+25
y = i//7*40+115

invert
i = ((y-115)//40)*7+(x-25)//55
(i think)

account for offset
i = ((y-129)//40)*7+(x-967)//55

account for weird rendering
i = ((y-109)//40)*7+(x-940)//55
```

ok, its working, but the function that updates the date section of the screen is in the loop for being called every 5 seconds, which is sort of interfereing with this. however, instead of making a whole bunch of detections and stuff, im gonna add some form of scheduling sections of the screen to be processed (which should make things cleaner)

ok, so it’s “working” as in updating the section when necessary, but there’s a bit of weird behavior being that it requires me to wait around 3 seconds (I assume it’s probably waiting for the 5 second update) and mouse gets stuck on True...

well, typing that I think the problem might actually be I’m not updating that section telling me that info... wait a minute... ok somethings definetely broken, its being scheduled but isnt running... ok its now fixed! turns out it was something that shouldve worked but idk, its working now! im gonna go optimize some of the other stuff! ok, things have been a bit more optimized (reminders section is only updated when neccesary) and it looks pretty speedy!

ok, started some work on the date conversion things, but its a bit tricky to do...
